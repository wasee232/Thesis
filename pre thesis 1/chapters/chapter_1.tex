\section{Objective}
The ultimate goal of the research is to design and realize a multi-stage, multifaceted deep learning system that has been specifically designed to achieve the goal of detecting and recognizing the Bangla license plates in extreme motion blurs and geometric distortion scenarios. This research concentrates on addressing the major performance reduction that current Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) systems have experienced addressing the issue of high-speed vehicle use in unconstrained conditions. The study will also use the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 architecture to achieve high plate localization to make sure that the study has high sensitivity of detection in the complex urban backgrounds. One of the main goals of this study is to introduce DeblurGANv2 as a specially designed image denoising assistant, which is expected to reinstitute high-frequency texture detail in the image of a license plate lost in the motion to reduce the loss of character-level fidelity that often initiates the occurrence of a false segmentation. Moreover, the study aims to create and implement a dedicated Optical Character Recognition (OCR) which is specifically trained on the complex Bengali script, solving the particular issues of the Matra relations and non-Latin character structure that are not solved by the conventional models. The final aim of this study is such that it will deliver an integrated and strong pipeline which will greatly improve recognition accuracy and operational stability in the real world systems like highway surveillance and criminal investigations. This study has the potential to supply a scalable and efficient solution to close the technical divide between existing restoration methods and the local script needs of Bangladesh to both enhance intelligent transportation systems and the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts in this country.
